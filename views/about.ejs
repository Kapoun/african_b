          <h6>Our History</h6>
          <p>
            The foundation of our church is deeply rooted in divine prophecy. Before his birth, it was foretold that a great leader‚Äîa ‚Äúking‚Äù‚Äîwould be born to Maria Nyanga. True to this vision, Muyikuva Shiyonga was born blind. When taken to a seer, who had earlier prophesied the birth of the King and sanctified him, his sight was miraculously restored within three days.
          </p>
          <p>
            From a young age, Saint Muyikuva Shiyonga demonstrated remarkable spiritual gifts, including visions and the ability to prophesy. By the age of 21, in 1945, his divine calling had become undeniable. On August 5, 1966, while trading cattle at Lubao Market, he received a powerful revelation from the Holy Spirit, directing him to establish a church. Obedient to this divine call, he founded the <strong>African Kenya SABCRYNNSK of Soi Praying and Healing Church</strong>, which has since grown into a pillar of faith and healing.
          </p>
          <p>
            For 25 years, Saint Muyikuva Shiyonga led the church with divine wisdom and spiritual authority, performing miracles and guiding his followers in faith. After his passing on October 11, 1991, leadership passed to his third-born son, Ronald Ambulwa, who had been appointed and anointed by his father through the Holy Spirit. Today, he continues to carry the torch‚Äîoffering spiritual leadership and administrative direction to the congregation.
